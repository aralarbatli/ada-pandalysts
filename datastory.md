### Introduction: What You Speak Matters More than You Think

As of 2023, there are 7'193 spoken and written languages around the world, with only 193 UN recognised countries on the map. These languages fundementally define our ways of perceiving, thinking and communicating. Withing a language lies an entire world, and within different languages, worlds collide. Just by tracking a single language, we pull the string for a story of demographics, history, culture and if we are lucky, even bags of gold.

The movie industry is far-reaching and near omnipresent. It helps transmit ideas and emotions all across the globe to different peoples and cultures, maybe even helping the creation of certain values shared by all around the globe. What better place to study the impact of languages? 

Many different audiances have created strong connections with certain movies, either their local movies in their native languages, or international blockbusters released in one of the most spoken languages in the world. Many movies only have one language for a local audiance, while some reach eleven different ones (some even invented). The short yet detectable presence of a language in a movie might be a glimpse into a demographic reality of huge an acute importance. Some cultures are so affiliated with a concept or a genre that we can't think of these without them (is Paris *really* the City of Love?).

Does more languages mean more money? Which languages make more money? What are the secondary languages in big movie producing countries and does it align with known demographics? Which languages are present in a given genre, and does it align with known stereotypes, like a French Romance or a Chinese Martial Arts movie?

To answer these questions, let us take you a journey of languages in movies, in the language of data analysis!

### The Data Itself

The CMU Movie Corpus Dataset, a corpus of ~80'000 movies released between 1888 and 2016 with every detail pertaining to each movie, is our main dish. We seasoned this dish with a generous amount of Box Office Mojo Worldwide Yearly Box Office Dataset for additional box office revenue data and The Movies Dataset for an additional taste of movie budget. This body of data contains information about the length, the budget, the total revenue, the affiliated genres, the year of release and the list of languages of the movies present, many more pieces of information relating to them. 

[ Insert Relevant Distributions Describing the Dataset ]

Using this data, we will answer 4 key questions:

1. Is there a correlation between language variety in a movie and its box office revenue?

2. The use of which languages are associated with a higher box office revenue?

3. Which languages a country's movies have other than their native one?

4. Which languages are more present in a specific genre?


(Mignhui's original text)

Languages are an important part of a movie, helping us infer production and plot context, availability and historical or artistic references. Yet it can tell us a much bigger story, one of utility, cultural blending and genre-specific expectations. We will study the relationship between the languages present in a movie and the box office revenue, understand if languages present in a country's movies will align with known cultural interactions and test if certain languages dominate certain genres. Data cocnerning a cohort of approximately 80'000 movies from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus datatset, released between 1888 and 2016 and appropriately enriched, is to be considered. We will fit a linear model to predict the box office revenue of a movie given its language composition, and will attempt to test certain stereotypes pertaining to the Martial Arts, Romance and Gangster movie genres while making similar assessments in the War and LGBT tagged movies.
