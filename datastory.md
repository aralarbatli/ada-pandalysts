### Introduction

Languages are an important part of a movie, helping us infer production and plot context, availability and historical or artistic references. Yet it can tell us a much bigger story, one of utility, cultural blending and genre-specific expectations. We will study the relationship between the languages present in a movie and the box office revenue, understand if languages present in a country's movies will align with known cultural interactions and test if certain languages dominate certain genres. Data cocnerning a cohort of approximately 80'000 movies from the CMU Movie Summary Corpus datatset, released between 1888 and 2016 and appropriately enriched, is to be considered. We will fit a linear model to predict the box office revenue of a movie given its language composition, and will attempt to test certain stereotypes pertaining to the Martial Arts, Romance and Gangster movie genres while making similar assessments in the War and LGBT tagged movies.
